# Analysis on Kickstarter Campaign Data: Outcomes vs. Launch Date and Outcomes vs. Goals 

### Purpose

-This seeks to understand two factors that influence the success or failure of Kickstarter campaigns, specifically the impact of date of launch as well as the goal request.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-I did not encounter too many challenges with this analysis. I had a minor equipment difficulty in navigating between the Excel COUNTIFS() formula with my laptop's touchpad, in particular because it grew to be evaluating four different conditions.

## Results

- The first conclusion is that the summer seems like the best time to begin a campaign in the Theater category. The level of failed campaigns remains relatively consistent throughout the year, staying within a range of about 20 for each month. However, the number of successful campaigns peaks dramatically in May, and tails off until September, when it is back to similar levels as the rest of the year. The second conclusion would seem that early in the year may have a slight preference to the end of the year, beyond any seasonal factors. January and February's levels of successful plays outpace those for November and December, suggesting an impact goes beyond simply "Winter."

- The graph for the Outcomes by Goal is less clear. Although there does seem to be some negative correlation (i.e. as funding Goal rises likelihood of success falls), the small numbers of campaigns above $15,000 makes any strong analysis very difficult. The vast majority of campaigns, as well as successful campaigns, occur below the $15,000 level.

- This data is very limited, particularly for something like Kickstarter campaigns for theater productions. For items with a more creative or less tangible element, factors like month or amount of ask only impact to a certain degree. Some greater level of detail on the types or genre of the plays could add depth, as well as data around the creators or groups seeking funding and their followings or level of "influence," for lack of a better word. For instance, ignoring the fact that he would never need a Kickstarter, Juan Manuel Miranda is likely to host a successful theater campaign regardless of time of launch or funding amount.
